| Dimension | Estimated | Actual | Error % | Direction |
|-----------|-----------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Task Count | 12 | 14 | 14% | under |
| Agent Count | 7 | 6 | 17% | over |
| Rework Rate | 20% | 0% | 20pp | over |

GRADE: B
ROOT_CAUSE: Rework rate overestimated — estimated 20% based on multi-agent coordination risk from echo-calculator precedent, but API Contract Phase pattern (designed after echo-calculator) prevented the cross-agent interface drift that drove rework in past high-complexity projects. Agent count overestimated by 1 because operations-agent served as both OAuth specialist AND one of the 3 CLI agent developers, rather than being a separate role.
CALIBRATION: PROJ-2026-0210-novotechno-collections | 4/5 | Engineering Operations | Complex system (3 CLI agents + shared infra) | High (4-5) | tasks=12/14 | agents=7/6 | rework=20%/0% | M | "First Operations domain project; 0% rework validates API Contract Phase for coordination-heavy systems"
